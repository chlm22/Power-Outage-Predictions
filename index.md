# Predicting with Power Outage Dataset
## by Hae In Lee

### What are we predicting? We can essentially predict anything we want to know about this dataset ! 

### Before we dive into predicting anything, let's explore the dataset!

# Introduction
## What is this dataset about? 
This dataset comes from Purdue University's LASCI Research Data on Power Outages in the US, by state, from January 2000 to July 2016. It provides information on the geographical locations of these events, regional climate data, land-use patterns, electricity consumption trends, and the economic characteristics of the states impacted by these outages. 

## Why is this dataset even worth looking at?
This data can help identify and analyze past outage trends, which can help determine the outage and impact economic, social, and environmental trends. This can help improve the way we risk manage, respond and prepare for unforeseen events that can cause power outages. 

## General overview of the dataset
In total, there are 1534 rows and 55 columns (variables). 
For our analysis purposes, we will only be looking at a couple of the variables

### This chart shows the columns for analysis

| Columns from Power Outage Dataset     | Description    |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **YEAR**                              | Indicates the year when the outage event occurred |
| **U.S._STATE**                        | Represents all the states in the continental U.S. |
| **CAUSE.CATEGORY**                    | Categories of all the events causing the major power outages |
| **OUTAGE.DURATION**                   | Duration of outage events (in minutes) |
| **CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED**                | Number of customers affected by the power outage event |
| **TOTAL.CUSTOMERS**                   | Annual number of total customers served in the U.S. state |

# Dataset Cleaning 
To use the data from the columns, we first need to clean them up.

First, I dropped all the columns I will not be using for the analysis. 
I kept only seven columns, YEAR, U.S._STATE, OUTAGE.DURATION, CAUSE.CATEGORY, CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED, TOTAL.CUSTOMERS, POPULATION


|   YEAR | U.S._STATE   |   OUTAGE.DURATION | CAUSE.CATEGORY     |   CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED |   TOTAL.CUSTOMERS |   POPULATION |
|-------:|:-------------|------------------:|:-------------------|---------------------:|------------------:|-------------:|
|   2011 | Minnesota    |              3060 | severe weather     |                70000 |       2.5957e+06  |  5.34812e+06 |
|   2014 | Minnesota    |                 1 | intentional attack |                  nan |       2.64074e+06 |  5.45712e+06 |
|   2010 | Minnesota    |              3000 | severe weather     |                70000 |       2.5869e+06  |  5.3109e+06  |
|   2012 | Minnesota    |              2550 | severe weather     |                68200 |       2.60681e+06 |  5.38044e+06 |
|   2015 | Minnesota    |              1740 | severe weather     |               250000 |       2.67353e+06 |  5.48959e+06 |
