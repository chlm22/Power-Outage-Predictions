# Predicting with Power Outage Dataset
### What are we predicting? 
### We can essentially predict anything we want to know about
### with this dataset... 

## Let's first see what this dataset is about
### This dataset comes from Purdue University's LASCI Research Data on Power Outages and focuses on Major Power Outage Risks in the U.S. This comprehensive dataset documents significant power outages across various states in the continental United States. It provides valuable information on the geographical locations of these events, regional climate data, land-use patterns, electricity consumption trends, and the economic characteristics of the states impacted by these outages.


### I am curious if we can predict
### the number of people affected by the power outage
### by seeing the cause of the outage and duration of the outage
