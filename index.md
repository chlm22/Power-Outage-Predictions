# Predicting with Power Outage Dataset
## by Hae In Lee

### What are we predicting? 
### We can essentially predict anything we want to know about this dataset ! 

### For this project, I will be predicting, 
I am curious if we can predict the number of people affected by the power outage
 by seeing the cause of the outage and duration of the outage

## Let's first see what this dataset is about
### This dataset comes from Purdue University's LASCI Research Data on Power Outages and focuses on Major Power Outage Risks in the U.S. This comprehensive dataset documents significant power outages across various states in the continental United States. It provides valuable information on the geographical locations of these events, regional climate data, land-use patterns, electricity consumption trends, and the economic characteristics of the states impacted by these outages.

### This chart shows some of the columns from the dataset that I will be using to answer my question!

| Columns from Power Outage Dataset     | Description    |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **U.S._STATE**                        | Represents all the states in the continental U.S. |
| **CAUSE.CATEGORY**                    | Categories of all the events causing the major power outages |
| **OUTAGE.DURATION**                   | Duration of outage events (in minutes) |
| **CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED**                | Number of customers affected by the power outage event |
| **TOTAL.CUSTOMERS**                   | Annual number of total customers served in the U.S. state |
